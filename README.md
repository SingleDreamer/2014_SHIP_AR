####Project 1: 
AR mazesolver. Use edge detection to translate an image (either static or camera) into a binary 2D array. 
<br>
  > 0 = free space <p>1 = wall <p> -1 = path
<br>

A* search is used to find a path and returns an array with the path imbedded. The array is translated into an image with the path superimposed on it.
